- My github profile: [https://github.com/mikrosk](https://github.com/mikrosk)

This is a collection of articles I have written. It's easier to maintain one site than creating github repository every time I start a new "research" project. In order of appearance:

- [Clock patch for the Atari Falcon explained in layman's terms](clockpatch/index.md)
- [Summary & drivers for various extended Atari XBIOS implementations](xbios/index.md)
- [All resources related to the CENTurbo II (a.k.a. CT2) accelerator card at one place](ct2/index.md) (work in progress)
