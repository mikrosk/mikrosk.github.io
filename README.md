This is a collection of articles I have written. It's easier to maintain one wiki than create a github repository every time I start a new "research" project.

My main website: http://mikro.atari.org
My hopefully-soon-to-be website: https://mikrosk.github.io (this page)

The list of articles:

- [Summary & drivers for various extended Atari XBIOS implementations](ct2/index.md)
- [Clock patch for the Atari Falcon explained in layman's terms](clockpatch/index.md)
- [All resources related to the CENTurbo II (a.k.a. CT2) accelerator card at one place](xbios/index.md)
