This is a collection of articles I have written. It's easier to maintain one site than creating github repository every time I start a new "research" project.

- My main website: [http://mikro.atari.org](http://mikro.atari.org)
- My hopefully-soon-to-be website: [https://mikrosk.github.io](https://mikrosk.github.io) (this page)
- My github profile: [https://github.com/mikrosk](https://github.com/mikrosk)

The list of articles (in order of appearance):

- [Clock patch for the Atari Falcon explained in layman's terms](clockpatch/index.md) (work in progress)
- [Summary & drivers for various extended Atari XBIOS implementations](xbios/index.md)
- [All resources related to the CENTurbo II (a.k.a. CT2) accelerator card at one place](ct2/index.md)
