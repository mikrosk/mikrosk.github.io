## Atari Sparrow resource page

This is my collection of Sparrow-related resources. So far it's only the overview of its revisions and serial numbers but I have many photos and most importantly, two working units in my possession so I plan to update it in near future.

### Sparrow revisions

There had been two revisions manufactured: rev.1 (usually on a hand-written label without the actual "rev.1" written) and rev.2 (more or less profesionally looking PCB).

The following list has been compiled from various Internet sources (eBay auctions, forum posts, computer history pages, ...). Sometimes I had to extract the PCB s/n from its case s/n - although I'm fairly sure that the "algorithm" is correct, I do place a note where such s/n is presented.

As far as I know, only rev.2 PCB had its case available. The cases I have been able to find so far:
- A3 25 11 0010 11
- A3 26 12 0010 33
- A3 26 13 0010 34
- A3 26 13 0010 35
- A3 26 13 0010 45

The fourth number (from the right) serves as an ID for the PCB (x=0) and case (x=1), as does the eighth number (1 = case, 3 = PCB).

#### rev.1:
- A3 22 23 0000 04
- A3 22 23 0200 06
- A3 2? 23 0000 07 (? is missing, perhaps a typo as it's hand written?)
- A3 24 23 0000 17

#### rev.2:
- A3 25 31 0000 08
- A3 25 31 0000 11 ("calculated" from the case s/n A3 25 11 0010 11)
- A3 25 32 0000 25
- A3 26 32 0000 32
- A3 26 32 0000 33 ("calculated" from the case s/n A3 26 12 0010 33)
- A3 26 33 0000 34
- A3 26 33 0000 35
- A3 26 33 0000 37
- A3 26 33 0000 40
- A3 26 33 0000 45 ("calculated" from the case s/n A3 26 13 0010 45)
- A3 26 33 0000 48
- A3 26 33 0000 58
- A3 26 33 0000 59
- A3 26 34 0000 50

There were two batches of the rev.2 (05/1992 and 06/1992). As of why #50 has "34" in its s/n I do not know (but I do have a clear photo of such PCB available).

### Number of Sparrows produced
This makes only 17 (rev.1) + 59 (rev.2) = 76 publicly known Sparrows in the world (assuming the numbering had restarted for rev.2).
