 1.   - INTRODUCTION -

The  Sparrow  is  the  newest  enhancement  in  the  series  of
Atari ST
    compatible 68000 - based computers. It is upward compatible
with the
    Atari STe, and includes a number of enhanced features.

The hardware specifications of the computer is as follows:

-    Motorola MC68030 at 8Mhz (default)  or 16MHz, software
selectable.

-    RAM:    Dual-purpose   (video/system)   RAM,  configuration 
is  as
    follows:

For  16  bit  wide  video  bus  possible  configurations are:
512Kbytes,
    1Mbytes, 2Mbytes, 4Mbytes, 8Mbytes and 14Mbytes.

For 32 bit wide video bus possible configurations are: 1Mbytes,
4Mbytes
    and 14Mbytes.

-    ROM:  2  socketed  ROMs,  providing  256Kbytes or 512Kbytes
of 
ROM
    space (strappable).

(bits)

    Programmable    Programmable (4/8)             6

-     The Sparrow also supports the XGA high color mode which
enables up
    to  65536  possible  direct  color  combinations. This 
option 
also
    supports  automatic  pixel scroll capability since each video
memory
    word corresponds to one pixel.

-    The video shifter supports both 16 or 32 bit wide data  bus 
width.
    It  retrieves  video  data  by  page  mode  from  DRAM. It 
supports
    programmable overscan and pixel scrolling.

-      The Sparrow  supports  the  necessary  logic  to  support 
future
    addition of an Internal Hard Disk (IDE Interface).

-      The  Sparrow  supports all the necessary controls to
support
full
    implementation of Interlace on TV's. This includes  Field 
sync 
and
    Equalization pulses for TV. This feature enables enhanced TV
display



```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 3
```

    by  enabling  the  display of 400 lines or more on TV's. The
Sparrow
    also supports interlace on monitors, to enable display of 400

lines
    on color monitors.

-   The Sparrow contains a built in Blitter.

-   The  Sparrow supports the industry standard analog RGB color
monitor
    interface as well as monochrome  interface  and  a  composite

video
    interface  for  PAL,  SECAM  and  NTSC  TV   standards. It 
supports
    monochrome monitors, color monitors and the VGA monitor.


-  The Sparrow has a Parallel I/O port, implemented using   one 
of 
the
    parallel   ports   on the General Instruments AY-3-8910 /
Yamaha YM-
    2149 sound chip.

-  The Sparrow has  one low-speed  async  serial  I/O  port 
(implemented
    using the 68901 MFP).

-  The  Sparrow  has  an   ST/MEGA compatible intelligent
keyboard,
with
    mouse and joystick ports.  It also has the hooks to connect
to
the
    new Atari Universal Keyboard Controller.

-  The Sparrow supports the standard SCSI Interface (for Hard
Disk,
Laser
   Printer, CD-ROM, etc).

-  The Sparrow has a  Floppy disk controller and interface that
supports
   720 Kbytes or 1.44Mbytes floppies, sharing  the  DMA 
channel.It has
   also an option for quad density floppies.

-  The Sparrow has a  Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)

-  The  Sparrow  has  an   Atari ST compatible cartridge port
(128
Kbyte
    storage).

-  The Sparrow has enhanced quad channel sound capabilities:
     12 bit, stereo DAC with parallel (8bit) or serial (16bit)
I/F.
      8 bit, stereo ADC with 16bit serial output.
      Digitally controlled tone, volume and fade via microwire
I/F
   The  sound chip (RASCAL) interfaces with the new Sparrow DMA
chip
      (which also contains the DMA support for disk transfers).

-  The Sparrow contains  the  PSG  Yamaha  YM-2149  for 
producing 
music
    synthesis, sound effects and audio feedback.

-  The  Sparrow  contains  a  GENLOCK option to synchronize the
internal
    clock to an external sync signal. In case of  Genlock  and 
XGA 
the
    Sparrow  outputs  a  special  control  bit  for each pixel to
enable
    programmable switching between internal or external video
source. In
    this case the number of possible colors is reduced to 32768.

2.  - MAIN SYSTEM -

The  Sparrow  is intended to be a compatible, high-performance
extension
    of the Atari STe architecture.

2.1.   - PROCESSOR -

The Sparrow uses the Motorola 16 Mhz MC68030  32-bit 
microprocessor.
    Support  circuitry  built  around  the  68030  allows 
switching the
    processor clock between 16 Mhz and 8 Mhz. Processor clock
control is
    provided by control  bit  in  a  configuration  switch  I/O 
address
    (FF8006).

2.2.   - ROM -

The  system  includes  on-board  sockets  for  a  set of  2 1Mbit

ROMs,
    providing  a total of 256Kbytes ROM.  Since system bus access
is 16-
    bits wide, both ROMs must  be  present.
Jumpers    are    provided    to   allow   the   use  of  27256, 
27512,
    27010/27C1001, and  57101/27C1000  EPROMs,  in  addition   to

53100
    ROMs.    The  default jumper position allows the use of 27512
EPROMs
    (for a total of 128Kb  of  ROM)  as  well  as 571001/27C1000 
EPROMs
    or 531000 ROMs (for a total of 256Kb of ROM).  32  pin 
sockets 
are
    provided,  although  27256, 27512, and 531000 only use the
bottom 28
    pins. The Sparrow supports by default  125ns EPROMs/ROMs. It
can  be
    programmed to support  250ns devices.

An  image of the first 8 bytes of  ROM  resides  in  the first  8

bytes
    of  the  RAM memory. These first 8 bytes
(0x00000000-0x000007)  are
    accessible only in supervisor mode.  Attempts to read from
this
area
    in user mode or any write are generate bus error. The  full 
ROM
    resides at the memory location 0x00E00000 - 0x00EFFFFF.
Among the tasks this ROM perform are system initialization and
boot
code
    that  can  boot from a floppy or SCSI device.   The ROM  is
expected
    to  contain a  multi-lingual  implementation  of  TOS.
Moreover,  if
    sufficient  space is available,  ROM-based  service
diagnostics
will
    be provided.

2.3.   - RAM -

The basic system includes 512Kb to 14Mb of dual-purpose  RAM 
which 
 is
    used   for   both   video  and system memory. This is
implemented by




```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 5
```

    using 8 bit wide SIMMS (Single In line Memory Modules), 
which 
must
    be used in pairs.

The  DRAM  devices  used  can  have one of the following
configurations:
    256Kbitx1, 256Kbitx4, 1Mbitx1, 1Mbitx4, or 4Mbitx1. Each SIMM
module
    is 8 bit (byte) wide and can be 256K, 1M or 4M  deep. The 
following
    schematics  show  the  possible configuration for 16 bits
wide
video
    bus, using 256K type DRAMs:


    - Total RAM -          - SIMM  -                  
-SIMM-   512Kbytes          |---- 256Kbytes----| 
   
|------256Kbytes-----|


using two pairs of the same type of SIMMs gives 1Mbytes as
follows:

     1Mbytes          |-----256Kbytes----|     
|-------256Kbyes-----|
                      |-----256Kbyes-----|     
|-------256Kbytes----|

Using 1M type DRAM devices instead of 256K type  devices  gives 
2Mbytes
    using  the  first  scheme  (one pair of SIMMs), or 4Mbytes
using the
    second scheme (two pairs of  SIMMs). Using  4M  type  devices

gives
    8Mbytes  with  one  pair of SIMMs or 16Mbytes for two pairs
of
which
    only the lower 14Mbytes are used.

For 32 bits wide video bus  the  basic  configuration  using 
256k 
type
    devices would be:
- Total RAM     - SIMM -      - SIMM -         - SIMM -        
-SIMM-

  1Mbytes   |--256Kbytes--| |--256Kbyes--| |--256Kbytes--|
|--256Kbytes--|

Using 1M type devices would give 4Mbytes and using 4M type
devices
would
    give 16Mbytes of which only the lower 14Mbytes are used.

There are four resources that compete for the memory apart from
the
CPU.
    These  resources,  in  decreasing order of priority are:
Video,
DMA,
    Refresh and  Blitter.  Actually,  only  two  of  these 
resources
    arbitrate  for  the  system bus in a normal arbitration
process: the
    DMA and the Blitter. In STe the Video does not really
arbitrate 
for
    the bus but use a timeshare scheme to share memory accesses
with CPU    cycles. Also,  in  STe  the  DMA 
arbitration  for disk
transfers is
    controlled by the DMA device READY line, while the
arbitration
logic
    resides in the MCUG. In STe, the  sound  DMA  shares  the 
timeshare
    mechanism with the video and does not really arbitrate for
the
bus.
In Sparrow the situation is different. The new DMA chip contains
the DMA
    arbitration  logic  that was in the MCUG (in STe). It
arbitrates for
    the bus either for DMA disk transfers or sound DMA accesses.
The DMA
    arbitration has higher priority than the Blitter 
arbitration.
Thus,
    a  DMA arbitration will interrupt the Blitter operation. The
Blitter
    will resume control of the system bus when  the  DMA  
releases 
the
    bus.





```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 6
```
In  Sparrow,  video  accesses  use  page  mode  and  thus  the
timeshare
    machanism used in STe cannot be employed. Instead, any video
request
    for memory access will stall the current  bus  cycle  if  it 
is  an
    access  to the DRAM (be it a CPU cycle or another bus master:
DMA or
    Blitter). This is done by inserting wait states into the
current bus
    cycle (by not activating DTACK). While the current bus cycle 
is  in
    wait  states,  the  memory  bus (which is separate from the
CPU
data
    bus) is used for video accesses. When video access 
terminates, 
the
    DTACK  is activated which enables the current bus cycle
tocomplete.
    Same scheme is used for refresh request. Thus, video and
refresh can
    access the memory without being delayed by any bus master or
by 
the
    CPU.
The  MC68030 accesses to on-board RAM typically  require 4 clock
cycles.
    There is no provision for parity or ECC  protection  on the  
system
    RAM.    The  reliability  of  current  DRAM  technology 
makes 
this
    unnecessary.

The  first  0x800  bytes  (2K)  of   RAM  
(0x00000008-0x000007FF) 
 are
    accessible  only in supervisor mode.    Attempts  to  read 
or
write
    to  this  area  in  user mode generate bus error.


2.4.   - System Control Unit -

2.4.1.   - Interrupt Mask and Current Status -

The Sparrow interrupt priority assignments are as follows:

   Level          Definition

   7 (highest)    NMI
   6              MFP interrupts
   5
   4              Vertical blanking (sync)
   3
   2              Horizontal blanking (sync)
   1 (lowest)

There is hardware for enabling use of Level 1 and Level  3  as 
external
    positive  edge  VPA  type  interrupts.  This  feature can be
used for
    parallel port ACK by srapping the external ACK to EXTINT (1 
or 
3).

There  is also hardware for enabling use of Level 5 as external
negative
    edge regular interrupt. This  feature  can  be  used  by 
SCCINT  by
    strapping  it  to EXTINT5.  EXTINT7 is also encoded
asnegative
edge
    interrupt.











```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 7
```

2.4.2.   - Bus Error Circuitry -

The SCU also implements  a  system  bus  error  circuitry.   If 
nothing
    concludes a bus cycle within a 16us timeout (programmable to
32us)
    the SCU will signal  a bus error.   Bus  error  is  also 
asserted
    if  certain conditions are violated, such as writing to ROM,
writing
    byte sized data to a word sized register, or writing to
system
memory
    when the processor is in user mode.

2.5.   - Floppy/ACSI Interface -

The   ST   compatible  Floppy/ACSI  subsystem  interfaces between

dual-
    purpose  RAM  and  the  internal floppy disk controller. 
Also,
the
    standard SCSI Port interfaces to devices  such  as  laser 
printers,
    hard  disk drives,  and CD-ROMs.

2.6.   - Configuration Switch Control -

The Sparrow implements an 8 bit configuration switch register at
address
    FF9200  to indicate the presence or absence of options.
Depending on
    printed circuit board layout, the register may be
implemented
using
    an 8 bit DIP switch, solder pads, or double "row of stacks"
jumpers.
    A  bit will read as a "1" if the circuit is open. The
following
bits
    have been assigned meanings:





  Bit           Meaning

  7             0 - no DMA sound hardware is installed.
                1 - DMA sound hardware is available.

  6             0 -  high  speed  (16  Mhz)  Floppy  disk 
controller  is
                          installed.
                1  -  only  low  speed (8 Mhz) Floppy disk
controller is
                          installed.

  5             1  -  don't care.
                0  -  quad density floppy.

Bits 0-4 of this I/O address are not used.


# 3. Device Subsystems

The Sparrow architecture supports the following device 
subsystems:

-    Standard SCSI Port

-    floppy disk interface sharing the ST "ACSI" DMA channel
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 8
```
-    serial port and  an   external   interrupt  port  connected to  MFP controller

-    a  Centronics  parallel  printer  port driven by the Yamaha YM-2149 sound chip

-    a ST/MEGA compatible intelligent  keyboard,   mouse,   and joystick
     interface and option for interfacing to the new Atari Universal 
     Keyboard Controller.

-    a port supporting application and diagnostic cartridges

-    two  controller  ports  for  additional  joysticks as well as light
     pen/gun and paddle controllers.

## 3.1. SCSI

The hard disk drive  interface  is  provided  through  a 
standard SCSI Interface  using  the  5380  NCR SCSI Controller. Transfers
can take place at up to 1.5Mb/s.

The   SCSI  interface  uses  a  50 pin  connector  with  the 
following  pin assignment:

           1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,27,29,
           31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,20,22,
           24,28,30,34 - GND
           2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 - Data Bus
           18 - Parity
           32 - ATN
           36 - BSY
           38 - ACK
           40 - RST
           42 - MSG
           44 - SEL
           46 - CD
           48 - REQ
           50 - IO

## 3.3. Floppy Disk (FDD)

The Sparrow floppy disk subsystem is designed  around the  AJAX
(WD1772) Floppy  Disk  Controller  supporting  one floppy disk drive. 

It is    a higher speed  version  of the 1772 and
supports 1.44Mb (formatted) capacity drives.

The  subsystem  interfaces  to  the  dual-purpose   RAM through
the ACSI DMA controller.  Commands and arguments are sent to the FDC
by first writing  to   the  DMA  Mode  Control Register to select the
desired FDC register and then writing the data bytes.
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 9
```
The standard floppy for the Sparrow is the  3.5  inch floppy 
disk with the  capacity  of 720 Kbyte (formatted).   The 1.44Mb drives
will be available as an option.  Also, since the AJAX floppy disk
controller supports quad density floppies, this is also available as an
option.

## 3.4. MFP

A  68901  Multi-Function  Peripheral   (MFP)   controller  is
used  to provide  system  timers,  low  speed  RS232C  serial  port, 
and  an interrupt   controller. The  MFP is used in a way that is
compatible with the ST.  It provides both a serial port and interrupt
control.

The baud rate clock for the MFPs serial  transmitter  and 
receiver is derived  from  the timer D output of the MFP. Given the MFP's
2.4576 MHz clock,  baud  rates  up  to  19.2Kbaud can be supported
on these    serial ports.

The  RS232  port  uses  a  DB  25 pin P connector with the
following pin assignments:

        1 - protective ground
        2 - transmitted data
        3 - received data
        4 - request to send
        5 - clear to send
        7 - signal ground
        8 - data carrier detect
       20 - data terminal ready
       22 - ring indicator

Request to send and Data terminal ready are issued by I/O port A
in the PSG.

## 3.5. Parallel Printer Port

The  Sparrow   architecture  includes  a  bi-directional  8-bit
parallel printer  port that implements a subset of the  Centronics 
standard. This  interface  is  through  the  General Instruments 
AY-3-8910  / Yamaha YM-2149 Programmable  Sound  Generator  (PSG)  chip.
It  is pinned  out  in  a  DB25S in a  way that  is  a  subset of
the Atari PC4.   The Centronics STROBE signal is generated from  a  PSG
 bit. The   Centronics   BUSY signal  from  the  printer  connects 
to one of the parallel input lines of the MFP to  permit  interrupt 
driven printing. Eight bits of read/write data are handled through
I/O port B  on  the  PSG  at  a  typical data transfer  rate 
exceeding 4000 bytes/second.
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 10
```
The Sparrow also supports  the  Acknowledge  signal  from  the 
parallel printer  port,  but  it  is an input pin which does not
generate any interrupt. It is connected to the COMBO device.

The parallel port uses a DB 25 pin S connector with the

## 3.6. Keyboard Interface

The  SP  keyboard  interface  is  completely compatible with the
ST/MEGA computers.    The   keyboard   is   equipped   with   a 
combination mouse/joystick  port  and  a  joystick  only  port.    The 
keyboard transmits   encoded  make/break  key  scan  codes  (with  
two key rollover),  mouse/trackball  data,  joystick data,  and
time-of-day. The keyboard receives commands  and  sends  data  via 
bidirectional communication    implemented     with     a    MC6850
Asynchronous Communications  Interface Adapter (ACIA).   The data 
transfer rate is   7812.5  bits/second.    All  keyboard functions,  such 
as key scanning, mouse tracking, command parsing, etc. are performed
by  a HD6301V1   8-bit    microcomputer    unit.     (See    the 
Atari Intelligent Keyboard (ikbd) Protocol, February 26, 1985.)

Sparrow also has hooks to  interface  to  the  new  Atari 
Universal Keyboard  Controller by incorporating the option to inhibit
the host UART clock until the keyboard is ready.

### 3.6.1. Mouse and Joystick Interface

The  Atari   two-button   mouse   is  a  mechanical, 
optomechanical, or optical   mouse   with    the    following    minimal
performance characteristics:  a  resolution  of  100  counts/inch,   a
maximum velocity   of   10  inches/second,  and maximum pulse phase
error of 50%.    The  joystick  is  a  four  direction  switch-type 
joystick with one fire button.

## 3.7 ROM Cartridge

The Sparrow cartridge port is  fully  compatible   with   ST 
cartridge. The  cartridge  is  physically  connected through a 40 pin
card edge connector ROM  cartridge  slot.   Cartridge ROMs  are  mapped
to  a 128K   memory   region   starting   at  0x00FA0000, extending to
0x00FBFFFF.

The cartridge must be installed with the chips facing down.

The cartridge uses a 40 pin card edge S connector with the
following pin assignment:

# 4. Video Subsystem

The  Sparrow  video  subsystem  is  designed  to extend the
existing STe modes.   Additional modes are available on the  Sparrow  that
allow more  colors  and  larger  screen  sizes.     The  Sparrow 
enhances functionality by permitting video display memory  to  start 
at any even  word  boundary (provided that each line also starts on
even-word boundary). This  enables  scrolling.   Also,  it  adds the
capability of scrolling horizontally on a one pixel  basis.  It  also
supports  interlace on  TV's   with  all  its necessary 
controls like Field sync and Equalization pulses. This enables  higher 
resolution video  diplays  (400 lines and more) on TV's. Interlace is
supported also on color monitors to support display of 400 lines or 
more. The    Sparrow  also supports overscan and a color pallet of 256
colors out of 262144  possible colors. In addition it  supports  the 
XGA high color  mode  which gives up to 65536 direct colors. In 16
bits video bus the overscan is supported in steps  of  16  pixels. In 
32 bits video bus the overscan is supported in steps of 32 pixels.

## 4.1. Video Configuration

The Sparrow supports 3 video modes in ST and programmable video
modes in SP mode.

     programmable   prog. (4/8)     prog. (16/256)    262144/6-bits

The machine will switch to either ST or SP mode automatically
when the corresponding shift mode register (ST or SP) is written.

In  addition a bit in the SP shift mode register switches the
Sparrow to the XGA high color mode. The TOS Operating System is
responsible for    updating the various video shifter register after power up 
or mode change.

As  the  table  indicates,  the  modes  are  set  through either
the STe Shift Mode Register (address FF8260) or the SP shift  mode 
register (address  FF8266).   16 word-wide registers comprise  the 
STe Color Palette (also known as the Color Look Up Table -  CLUT). 256
double word-wide registers comprise the SP color look up table.
Contained in  each  entry  are 12 bits (in STe mode) or 18 bits (in SP
mode) of color:   4-bits (STe) or 6-bits (SP) each for  red, green,
and blue.

Therefore,  a  total  of 4096 possible color combinations
(16x16x16) are selectable  in STe mode and 262144  possible  color 
combinations (64x64x64)  are  selectable  in  SP  mode. In  order   to
maintain compatibility  with  the  ST (which had 3 bits for each
color, right aligned within nibbles), the high order bit of each color in
STe mode is actually the least  significant  bit  of  color 
information. The following compares the CLUT entries for the ST and STe:
```
ST:  XXXX  X210  X210  X210
            red  green blue

STe: XXXX  0321  0321  0321
           red  green blue
```
The  monochrome  mode bypasses the color palette and is instead
provided with an inverter for inverse video controlled by bit  0  of 
palette register 0.

## 4.2. Video RAM/Controller/Display Interface

Video  display memory is configured  as  logical  planes (1,  2, 
4,  or 8) of interwoven 16-bit words  of  contiguous  memory  to 
form one    physical  plane  starting at any even word
boundary (in dual-purpose RAM only). The size of this plane depends on the  screen 
resolution and  the  number  of  color planes. For  example,   for
320x200 resolution  and  4 color planes it is 32000 bytes.   The 
starting address of  display memory is loaded into the Video Base
High, Video Base Mid, or Video Base Low Registers. This   register   is
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 14
```
loaded into   the Video  Address  Counter  (High/Mid/Low)  at the
beginning of each frame.   The address counter is incremented as  the
BitMap planes are read.

BitMap  planes  are transferred to  the  video  chip  buffer 
16-bits or 32-bits at a time.   The shifter then loads the video shift
register where one bit from  each  plane  is shifted  out  and
collectively used   as  the  index (plane 0 appears first in RAM and
provides the least significant  bit of  each  pixel)  to  a  specific STe
or SP Palette Register.

In XGA color mode each video memory word corresponds to one pixel
with 6 bits  color resolution for green, 5 for red and 5 for blue.
Thus, the video memory has to be organized differently compared to  the
other video  modes,  where  the  video  data is organized in color
planes.

Here, the video memory, starting at any even word boundary, 
contains the  representation  of  one  pixel  in  each memory word.
Thus, for representing a row of 320 pixels , 320 contiguous memory
words are used,  each word contains all the information necessary to
represent the   color  of  one  pixel,  out  of  65536  possible 
colors. This organization enables automatic pixel scrolling capability, 
just  by changing  the starting address of the first memory word in
the video memory space (however, when in 32bit video bus mode,
scrolling will be done in 2 pixel steps).

In case of Genlock and XGA the Green is reduced to only 5 bits 
(instead of  6) if the pixel control bit in SP shift mode register is
set, and the remaining bit is used as a Genlock key  to  enable 
programmable switching  between  external  or  internal video data on 
each pixel. This switching will be done by the external Genlock hardware.

### 4.2.1. Horizontal Scrolling

Two additional registers serve to implement a horizontal  smooth 
scroll capability. The  horizontal  pixel scroll register specifies
a pixel offset of 0 to 15 at which to begin display. Increasing  this
value by  one  will  have  the  effect of scrolling the entire
display one pixel to the left. The  other  register  is  the  extra  line
width register. This  register contains a number of words that is
added to the ending address of each display line to get the beginning
address of   the  next  display  line. It  has  the  effect  of 
putting  an undisplayed area to the right of the video  screen. By 
varying the horizontal  pixel  scroll register and the video base
registers, the    display video screen  can  be 
used  as  a  horizontally scrollable "window"  into  that  area. As  mentioned already, in XGA
high color mode the pixel scroll option is achieved  automatically,  by 
simply changing  the  starting address of the video memory. So, in
XGA mode the pixel scroll register has to be loaded with zeroes.

Since all the video parameters  timing  of  the  HSYNC,  VSYNC, 
Display Enable,    Blank,   Field   SYNC,   Equalization   pulses
etc. are programmable, the Sparrow can support a wide range  of 
monitors,  a variety  of  TV standards as well as programmable overscan.
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 15
```
The full interlace   capability  supported  by  the  Sparrow  enables 
higher resolution video displays (400 lines or more) on TV's.

The  video  use  a  19 pin  connector with the following pin assignments:

            1 - red
            2 - green
            3 - blue
            4 - pixel control/ mono out
            5 - ground
            6 - red return (ground)
            7 - green return (ground)
            8 - blue return (ground)
            9 - Audio in
           10 - sync return (ground)
           11 - Digital ground
           12 - composite sync
           13 - horizontal sync
           14 - vertical sync
           15 - external clock input (for GENLOCK)
           16 - EXT for GENLOCK
           17 - +12V for peritel
           18 - v1
           19 - v0

           * v0 and v1 correspond to the vv bits in VMC.

The audio in case of VGA monitor will be supplied by an internal
speaker in the Sparrow, enabled by signals from the PSG.

In addition there is an RCA Phone Jack for TV interface with the
following assignment:

         core - RF modulated video
         shield - ground

# 5. Music Subsystem

The  Sparrow  architecture  extends  the   music    subsystem 
presently available on the ST/MEGA computers.  The Sparrow mixes the
output of the  existing  ST  PSG  sound system  with  a  new DMA-driven
dual-channel  D-to-A subsystem (RASCAL  device).   The  Sparrow
combines these  two  sources   for  simple beeps,  and can be
connected to an external stereo amplifier for high-fidelity sound. In 
addition the resulting  audio  is sent  to an on-board speaker which is
controlled by a port on the PSG.

The   Sparrow  is  also  equipped  with  a  Musical  Instrument 
Digital Interface  (MIDI) which provides high speed serial
communication  of musical data to and  from  more  sophisticated synthesizer
devices.
```

## 5.1. Programmable Sound Generator

The ST sound system using the General  Instruments  AY-3-8910  /
Yamaha YM-2149   Programmable   Sound  Generator is present in the
Sparrow.

The YM-2149 Programmable Sound Generator produces  music 
synthesis, sound  effects, and audio feedback. With an applied clock
input of 2 MHz, the PSG is capable  of providing  a  frequency  response
range between 30 Hz (audible) and 124 KHz (post-audible).   The 
generator places   minimal  amount   of   processing burden on the main
system (which acts as the sequencer) and has the ability to  perform
using three  independent voice channels.   The three sound channel
outputs are mixed, along  with  Audio  In,  and   sent   to   the
external television   or  monitor  speaker  (the  PSG has built in
digital to analog converters).

## 5.2. DMA Sound

The Sparrow also  includes  a  new  DMA-driven   sound
subsystem that allows   the playback or synthesis of complex waveforms at a
variety of sampling rates. This feature  is  supported  by  the  new 
RASCAL device  which  is  driven  from the new DMA device  (same DMA
device that controls the disk DMA cycles).

### 5.2.1. Overview

Sound in the form of digitized  samples  is  stored  in system
memory. These samples are fetched from dual-purpose memory during
horizontal blanking  (transparent  to   the   processor)   and  provided
to digital-to-analog converters (DAC's) in the RASCAL device at
a constant sample frequency specified by the  user. The outputs
of the DAC's are then low pass filtered into a "walkman"
type,micro-stereo connector and to the on-board speaker.

Two channels are provided.    They are  intended  to  be  used
as the left  and right channels of a stereo system when using the
raw audio outputs from the machine. They  are mixed together when fed 
to the on board speaker.          A MONO mode is provided which 
will feed the   same  data   to  both  channels  simultaneously.    The
only restriction placed on MONO mode is that there must be an even
number of samples (see data format section for details).

### 5.2.2. Data Format

Each  sample  is  stored  as  an   eight   bit   quantity,    the
most significant   bit   is  the  sign  and  the  other  seven 
bits are magnitude.   In  the  stereo scheme there is one  word  per 
sample, the  upper  byte contains the left channel sample and the
lower byte contains the right channel  sample.   In  the MONO  scheme
bytes are accessed sequentially.   However, they are still fetched a
word at a time.  Therefore,  there  must be an even number of samples.
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 17
```
A group of samples is called a frame.   A frame may  be played 
once  or    can    automatically    be repeated    forever. Frames 
occupy  a contiguous block of memory and are specified by  their
starting and ending  addresses.   The  ending  address is the address of
the last sample + 2.  An external clock is provided  to timer A of the
ST MFP at the end of each frame. This  can  be  used   as   an
interrupt. This   pulse   is   also  exclusive   OR'ed   with   the 
monochrome monitor detect bit, whose transition can generate  an 
interrupt  on bit 7 of  the MFP-ST  General  Purpose  I/O  Port.    Frames 
may be linked  together by defining a new frame while the current
frame  is being  played.   The  new frame will begin at the end of the
current frame.

### 5.2.3. MICROWIRE Interface

The  MICROWIRE  interface  provided  to  talk  to  the RASCAL's
software controlled Volume / Tone Control  is  a  general  purpose 
MICROWIRE interface to allow the future addition  of  other MICROWIRE
devices.
    
For this reason, the following description of its use will 
make  no assumptions about the device being addressed.

The  MICROWIRE  bus  is  a  three  wire  serial  connection and
protocol designed to allow multiple devices to be individually 
addressed  by the  controller.   The  length of the  serial data stream
depends on the destination device.    In general, the stream consists of
N bits of address, followed  by  zero or  more  don't  care bits, 
followed by  M bits of data.   The hardware interface which has been
provided consists  of  two 16  bit  read/write registers.   One data
register which contains the actual bit stream to  be  shifted  out 
and one    mask register which indicates which bits are valid.

Let's  consider  a  mythical  device  which  requires  two
address bits and one data bit.    For this device the total bit stream  is
three bits  (minimum).    Any   contiguous   three bits  of  the 
register pair may be used.    However,  since the most   significant 
bit  is shifted   first,    the   command will  be  received  by  the
device soonest if the three most significant bits are used.   Let's
assume:

- 01 is the device's address,  D  is  the  data  to  be written,

and

- X's  are  don't  cares.

Then  all  of  the   following register combinations will provide the same information to the device:

                1110 0000 0000 0000  Mask
                01DX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Data

                0000 0000 0000 0111  Mask
                XXXX XXXX XXXX X01D  Data

                0000 0001 1100 0000  Mask
                XXXX XXX0 1DXX XXXX  Data
```
SPARROW SPEC. REV A10                                       page 18
```
                0000 1111 1111 0000  Mask
                XXXX 01XX XXXD 0000  Data

                1111 1111 1111 1111  Mask
                01XX XXXX XXXX XXXD  Data

The  mask  register  needs  to  be  written  before  the  data
register.
    
Sending commences when  the  data  register  is  written  and
takes    approximately  16uS.   Subsequent writes  to   the  data 
and mask registers are blocked  until  sending  is  complete.
Reading the registers while sending is in  progress will  return  a 
snapshot of the shift register shifting the data and mask out.   This
means that you  know it is safe to send  the  next command when these
registers (or either one) return to their original state.   Note that
the mask register   does  not  need to be rewritten if it is already
correct. That is, when sending a series of commands the  mask 
register only needs to be written once.

### 5.2.4. Volume and Tone Control

The  RASCAL is used to provide volume, tone, and mixing control. 
This part is talked to using the MICROWIRE interface.   The device
has  a two bit address  field, address  = 10,  and a nine bit data
field. 

There is no way of reading the current settings.

The  input selector is used to enable and disable mixing the 
output  of the GI PSG with the DMA sound.   After reset, the input is
grounded, and  should  be  switched  to  either states 1 or 2
during tialization  to  avoid  level mismatches during later
switching.

## 5.3. Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)

The  MIDI  allows  the  integration  of  the  Sparrow series 
withmusic synthesizers,  sequencers, drum boxes, and other devices 
possessing MIDI  interfaces.   High speed  (31.25  Kbaud) serial 
communication of keyboard and program information is provided by two 
ports, MIDI OUT and MIDI IN  (the  MIDI  OUT also includes MIDI THRU
data).

The  MIDI  communicates through the MC6850  Asynchronous 
Communications Interface Adapter (ACIA) to the system bus.   The data
transfer rate is a constant 31.25 Kbaud of 8-bit  asynchronous data.

The MIDI OUT/THRU uses a  circular  DIN  5  pin  S  connector 
with the following pin assignment:

        1 - thru transmit data
        2 - shield ground
        3 - thru loop return
        4 - out transmit data
        5 - out loop return
```

```
The MIDI IN uses a circular DIN 5 pin S connector with the
following pin assignment:

        4 - in receive data
        5 - in loop return
